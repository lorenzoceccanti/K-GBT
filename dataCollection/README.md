## Readme Data collection

This folder contains the dataset used for the Business and Project Managment Project developed in 2024 by Lorenzo Ceccanti, UNIPI student at Diparimento di Ing. dell'Informazione.
Each JSON contains circa 1000 posts and embedded comments from the r_iphone Reddit community, in which users were collecting problems, discussing about the causes and the possible solution concerning the last iOS17 update at that time.

The JSON structure is as follows:

When my wifes ip13pm had the white screen, the only fix was to replace the screen. Good thing it was still under warranty and the replacement cost was free. Wish apple would recognize that this is a qc issue and they will replace it for free.",
