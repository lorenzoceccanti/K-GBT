        "post_text": "I can’t play any video or music on my iPhone. If I try to play a song on Apple Music, nothing happens and this code appears: An unknown error occurred(1852797029). If I try to play a video on YouTube, it shows the first frame and doesn’t play any of the video. Tiktok will also only load the first frame with no sound. Instagram will start showing the video but if I attempt to adjust the sound at all or if I turn on the sound, the video stops playing. I also can’t load any of my saved videos on my phone either. Phone calls don’t work since I can’t play any sound from my phone. Also, if I try turning the volume up and down with the side buttons, it bounces around on the left side of the screen and often reverts to the middle volume or a different volume altogether. \n\nI have so far tried: shutting and closing all apps, restarting my phone, hard reset on phone, updating my phone, clearing up storage on my phone, and resetting all the settings on my phone. The last thing I’m about to try is backing up my phone to iCloud and factory resetting. If that doesn’t work, I guess I’m cooked.\n\nHas anyone else had issues like this with their phone? I’ve tried googling it and it looks like this has never really happened to anyone else before.\n",

        "post_text": "I already posted about this else but thought I can try here as well.  I apologies that it’s repetitive. \n\nLast summer, I started receiving threatening voicemails from an \"unknown\" caller that continued for about six months before stopping. I wasn't living at the address disclosed in the voicemails at the time and felt a little creeped out. However, I have recently moved back, and even though the strange voicemails stopped over six months ago, I don't feel safe in my house, especially at night. I find myself triple-locking the doors and getting paranoid.  \n\nI have contacted my carrier service (T-Mobile) to see if they can provide me with more information but they didn’t lead anywhere. \n\nFor further context, my phone is an iPhone; the messages consist of a robotic voice inviting me to come to my address, the threat of r*pe, and so on. In some, I can hear the person breathing, which makes me think they are playing audio on another device of their message and putting it close to the speaker for me to hear. Also, they know my name and sometimes play messages in my first language and English. \n\nI just want to feel safe in my own house again, but don't feel this is serious enough to go to the police with, especially because the voicemail have stopped, but I don't think I can get over it until I know exactly if its a troll or a potential danger.

Is this something to be concerned about? \n\nAfter doing some research and hearing about strange cases of people using AirTags to track people, I decided to contact local authorities on her behalf. Her power went out earlier that night and a couple hours after it turned back on, she got these notifications. The officer I talked to on the phone said it was likely that her iphone just began to ping for possible AirTags in the vicinity after the power outage.  I have a couple old AirTags I used a year ago for travel purposes tucked away somewhere in the house, but like I said she was never connected to them, as it was just for my personal use.  However, I’d be somewhat surprised if those old AirTags was causing this problem, as we’ve had multiple power outages in the past year at that house, and haven’t ran into that problem once.\n\nThe house in a secluded/wooded area so the red dotted lines are quite peculiar and don’t make much sense in that regard.

I'll try being as thorough as I can. I've glanced and don't see anything similar to my particular situtation, but I do apologize if this has been posted elsewhere before.\n\n I'm having an issue with a group chat on my iPhone. The bar where you type your messages is missing. I can see new messages coming in but I cannot reply from my phone. It’s looks exactly like it would if you were to leave or were kicked out. However, I can sometimes reply in the same thread using on my MacBook or iPad. The issue is entirely random to where sometimes I can reply on my iPhone, and other times I can only respond on my iPad or MacBook. Regardless, I would say 95% of the time I can’t even respond on any device at all. \n\n To break it down more to maybe help with context more. There are 4 member’s in the group, including me. The three other people are all using iPhones and I am the only one having this issue, and only with this specific group chat. I can individually text each one of them perfectly fine. I even have other group threads with only two of them, and then another group thread with two of them. The problem doesn’t populate with each of them nor does it happen with being split up. \n\n Anyone have any ideas on how to fix this? My iPhone, iPad, MacBook are both up to date on software. I've tried restarting the phone, quitting the app on my phone, turning iMessage on and off, checking the send + receive settings, but nothing has worked so far. I have even spoken to Apple support, and went through their troubleshooting recommendations, but they were unable to solve it. They ended up having to escalate this issue to one of the  Senior Advisors, but unfortunately no solution was reached.",

You will need a new email but can easily make one with this [https://proton.me/mail](https://proton.me/mail) then use the email to make a new apple account. It will probably ask for a phone number but you can skip this. When your done you can swap out the new email account with your current email if it's not icloud. I truly hope you won't need this and get a fix :)",

I’d be okay with putting the case back on and trying to forget about it, but will this lead to issues? I thought about going in for a repair even despite not having apple care, but I read they will delete all my data, and I have multiple flights coming up (not checked in yet, I’m sure I could get all the flight data onto a new phone but I don’t want this one deleted until then). I could probably get a new one if I really had to and transfer my data that way, but if it’s unnecessary I’d rather wait. I’ll be flying to Greece soon and staying for five weeks, so I need to make a choice until Friday. ",

I took a very important video of a surprise party yesterday and noticed about 2 hours later that it was not in my galery. It is not in the deleted folder either or in iCloud. Today I called Apple Support and they said that there must have been an issue with saving the video so it is gone forever. 😭\n\nI am trying an iCloud Backup now and a Software Update but have little hope. \n\nAny advice what I could try? Other videos and fotos from yesterday are there but not this important one. Makes me very sad that it is gone 😭\n\nHope anyone can help, thanks! 🙏🏻",

Is there a way or an app that gives me a camera roll folder that has all my photos just from my camera? I thought iPhone was supposed to be clean and organized but this is not good lol.
