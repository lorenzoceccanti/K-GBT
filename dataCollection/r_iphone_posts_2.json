My screen is fully functional, still works... but has just separated from the rest of the Iphone and won't stick back in. Before I take it to a repair shop I wanted to see if anyone knew a DIY fix. I know it is not a ba\\*\\*ery issue because that is brand new (April 2024).  \n",

        "post_text": "I realize I'm grasping at straws here. My worst nightmare of the last 18 years came true a couple of weeks ago when I found the body of the longest, deepest love of my life, with a simple note identifying herself and asking responders to contact me.  I've since assisted with the care of her body and am now trying to wrap my head around her estate and wishes. I have access to her icloud account, including documents, photos, and imessages, via her Mac laptop which was only locked with a password, but I cannot get into her passcode-locked phone as the time delays are now at 8 hours on attempts. With me being an android user, the messages between us are not in her icloud account, so my last hope for anything useful is the (long shot) possibility that she recorded a voice memo or was typing a text to me at the end, but fell asleep before hitting send. Or, she may have been afraid to hit send before she'd passed, because she didn't want to be saved.  This seems unlikely, but is still in the realm of possible. Additionally, it seems like using the \"forgot passcode\" option will completely wipe the phone and restore solely that data that I can already see in her icloud account. With that in mind, I'm wondering if there are any remaining options beyond giving up on the possibility altogether.  Her relationship with her surviving parents was complicated, and often times close to estranged, but without any guidance from her, they will be the sole heirs to her estate. It's unlikely that's what she'd want, but I need something more than just my opinion on the matter to make any headway advancing her true wishes.",

        "post_text": "Just received an iPhone 12 Pro that I ordered via BackMarket. When I ordered it last week, I went a bit too fast and after looking at the vendor's profile, it is very sketchy and has a lot of complaints about quality.\n\nBut my iPhone is crispy clean. I didn't even order it in perfect condition and it's actually esthetically flawless, like brand new. I checked on 3utools and it says every part is new and the same as original, which is weird considered it shows it was bought 4 years ago... It seems too good to be true. 100% b\\*tt\\*ry h\\*alt\\*, original screen and everything... It would have been less weird to see that the b\\*tt\\*ry was replaced with a third party one, which is what refurbished phones are right? But why would you sell and actual perfect brand new iPhone as refurbished?\n\nThen I read about the \"Qianli iCopy Plus\" device which can copy identification from original parts to the new, cheap third party parts, so essentially making everything seem perfect even though the parts were replaced.\n\nSo is there actually another way than opening the device to see if for example, the b\\*tt\\*ry is genuine? It seems to me like there is no way to know, and I would prefer not paying 500‚Ç¨ for a \"fake\" phone.\n\nThanks in advance for your answers!",

I tried doing the restart (vol. up, vol. dn, hold home button) multiple times and nothing. Then it went into the screen that says to connect the iPhone and go to support.apple.com/iphone/restore. So, I tried that and tried to update and the update failed, so now it is telling me the only option is to factory restore. I also tried letting it go completely dead and then charging it again to see if that would do anything and nothing there either. \n\nI don't want to factory restore of course because I will lose all my pictures that are very important to me. \n\nso is there some type of third party software that can extract just the pictures from the phone or any possible way to just get those pictures?   i dont care about anything else on there i just want those. \n\n  \nThank you for your help in advance.

If the color is that important to you, which I would completely understand why, you can try to boost the saturation to see if that brings out the green, it should.",

Sometimes I'd put my card (Telenor) into it and it was worked fine. So the phone was proved to be unlocked. \n\nA month ago we change her mobile into a newer model. We would like to gave this old iphone to our young niece, so we made a factory reset, and with this we've actually killed the phone...\n\n  \nNow it's inpossible to install the iOS cause the phone doesn't accept the new SIM card, but not really any SIM that we insert. Even the old one what we used a long time ago.\n\nThe Apple service told us the phone is locked, and for crack it first we must prove it was an unlocked iPhone since we've purcahsed it.\n\n  \nCan anyone help me to install somehow the iOS again?

I'm wondering if the additional pins in the data cable will cause any issues in the long run. The provided Apple USB-C to USB-C cable in the box also has fewer pins, being a charging cable. I know this does not affect my charging speeds, as I'm using a 5W brick with it. My main concern is the connection pins.\n\nSome say different USB - C Cables are for different needs, Another say one for all. What's your thoughts?",

Those data specs only matter when you want to transfer large amounts of data to/from your phone via the cable (for example if you back up your phone or even just your photos to a computer).\n\nYou don't need to worry about the number of pins at all. A USB 3 cable will have more pins than USB 2 to support that higher data transfer rate.\n\nIf you want fast charging, you'll need a C to C cable (EDIT: any C to C cable will do. Doesn't matter if it's USB 2, 3, or even 4) and a charger that supports the USB Power Delivery protocol. Basically any legitimate USB C charger will support that these days. Anker and UGREEN are both good brands. Apple's first-party chargers are of course fine too.\n\nIf you only charge overnight and are happy with the 5W speed, any A to C cable should be fine. Again, Anker, UGREEN and Apple are all good options.",

The data pins aren't going to be a problem.\n\nIt gets a little more complicated with USB-C to USB-C cables. There are some cables that are really only good for charging and only have USB 2 data speeds, so they're not great for syncing or connecting external drives. And if you want to charge a laptop you should get a cable specifically designed for high power usage, since most general purpose USB cables can't carry all the power a laptop will want.",

I really used my old Iphone out, and now it can't last an hour without needing a charge. That's after multiple replacements, until Apple stopped fixing it. Seeing that all these service providers give you all these offers, I easily got myself on a modern iphone. I heard about the face password thing and stuff, but I honestly have no idea how to even use this thing. It's so big now too, with the large camera module, and the flashlight. They also moved the on button to the side, and there's no more do not do not disturb. I feel all of this is very dumb, but it's probably just me, hence why I moved to the reddit. ",

I have an IPhone 7 (iOS 15, which seems to be the highest update it can get because it says it is up to date) and when I click the info button on the network it doesn't show the option to view a password. Not only that, I also tried looking for a supposed \"edit\" button that should be somewhere in the corner, and still found nothing. Is there any way to view the passwords?",

It also has snooze automatically on as a default.\n\n\nIve missed 6+ alarms this week. I turned off attention awareness & standby. I cannot figure out why my alarms are silent or just not triggered.\n\nDoes anyone have a solution? I cant have a physical alarm clock because I need a quieter on due to the newborn being in the same room. I also have to set many alarms a day. Almost on every 2.5 hours for feeds & work stuff. \n\nIs there a better app that cant be silence? ",
