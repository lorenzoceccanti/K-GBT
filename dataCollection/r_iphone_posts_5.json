That way the phone with esim1 doesn't know anything beyond it's connected to a wifi network through which it can reach its mobile network.

        "post_text": "I’ve been having an issue lately where calls get randomly dropped or hung up immediately after connecting. This happens whenever I have wired earbuds connected (tried both official Apple EarPods and off-brand). I’ve also experienced an issue where Siri activates randomly or music or YouTube videos will randomly play or pause while using wired earbuds. AirPods work fine. I’m using iPhone 12 Pro. I’ve seen a few threads related to this topic on the Apple Support but haven’t seen any that have gotten resolved. Charging works fine so I don’t think it’s debris or anything in the charging port.\n\nAnyone have any idea what this problem is about? ",

        "post_text": "So I recently found out you can unlock phones from the network carrier. I just wanted to confirm a couple of details before pulling the trigger. I have been planning to upgrade for awhile (iPhone 12 currently) and I am interested in the AI features coming out, so the 15 Pro is what I'm aiming for.\n\nBest Buy offers 24 month 0% with their card (I have been a holder for 5 years, not taking on new credit for this lol) as well as a rewards promotion. This will also allow me to tack on a renewal for Best Buy Total (I buy a lot of shit from them lol) which gives me AppleCare and other goodies. They currently only sell prior generation unlocked iPhones so I have to look at a carrier phone if I want to pull the trigger on this now while the promotion is running. If this doesn't pan out, I might consider just getting the 16 via Apple directly when it releases. I'll weigh my options after reading the responses I get here.\n\nSo just to confirm some of my findings and a couple of questions:\n\n\t1. Financing it through the credit card will show as paid in full with the carrier, right?\n\n\t2. Verizon is 90 days after paid in full before you can unlock from network, right?\n\n\t3. ATT is 60 days after paid in full, right?\n\n\t4. I think I found that Tmobile is 2 days after? Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n\t5. I couldn't find anything for US Cellular about time after paid in full.\n\n\t6. Any other things I should know before executing?\n\nThank you very much for reading and any input you can provide.",

It’s freaking me out.\n\nSo you know how in the “recently” deleted album you see all the pictures you’ve deleted, and underneath it it says the number of days before it’s gone for good which means if you did 29 minus the days that it shows you get how many days ago you’ve deleted the photo?\n\n(For example: 29 minus 22 is 7 so 7 days ago I’ve deleted the picture.) \n\nSo now photos that I’ve deleted about 15-14 days ago, shows 22 when it should be 15! \nAnd some the pictures I’ve deleted three weeks ago or something like that shows 22 too. It’s not all the pictures it’s a specific amount but it’s so weird! I’m sure I’ve deleted it longer than 7 days ABSOLUTELY SURE.\nand every two days I look in the recently deleted photos, that’s why I’ve noticed the sudden change in the order of the deleted pictures.\n\nPlease help!! \n\nI’m so stressed my phone is compromised.\n\nNew iPhone 14 ",

I'm deeply integrated into the Google ecosystem, especially Google Photos, where I've bought extra storage. I have nearly 27 GB of photos in Google Photos.\n\nMy question is: Is there a way to ensure that the photos I take on my iPhone are automatically uploaded only to Google Photos and not to Apple Photos? It's quite annoying to delete photos twice.\n\nIf anyone has suggestions on how to achieve this or if there's a better alternative I should consider, I would really appreciate it! \n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

For reference, I have an average Asian face, sharp jaw and chin in all angles but with soft yet prominent cheeks. However, my camera decides to make me look as flat as a pancake with the round moon for a face. It can even make my eyes appear smaller. It’s very odd as my other phones and tablets (not of Apple) have no issue with their camera distortion.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else had this problem where their camera ruined their faces and somehow fixed the camera to appear more true to reality? Are there any settings that can make the camera more... less flat?",

Pick the 0.5x zoom and get close. You will notice your face gets more distorted the closer you go. If standard zoom doesnt cut it for you, use the 3x.\n\nif you are using the “selfie”/front facing camera, keep the phone further away from your face.\n\nEdit: if it still doesnt work, try asking your friends for a similar model iphone, if possible. That might make it clear if its only your phone or not.",

Dialing the above command might end up killing voicemail. You may need to contact your provider’s customer service line to get your voicemail access restored.",
