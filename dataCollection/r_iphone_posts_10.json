        "post_text": "I'm not sure if this question has already been answered in this subreddit, and it might be a dumb question, but I figured I'd ask anyway: can I charge my Iphone 14 with a Samsung wall plug?\n\nI've been using android phones my whole life, and just recently decided to switch to Apple. Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to get myself an Apple wall plug, so I only have the USB-C to lighting cable that came in the box, and I'm not sure whether or not I should buy an Apple wall plug before setting up my new Iphone.\n\nI appreciate any advice, and feel free to delete this post if it breaks any rules :)",

I guess I shouldn't promote lawsuits: \"I have tried every possible suggestion on the internet using multiple Windows PCs. I have one iPhone 13 Pro that refuses to show the DCIM folder no matter any possible suggestion on the internet. Trust me, I have tried them all. The funny thing is my iPhone 13 Pro works fine and I can easily pull off photos for work. My wife on the other hand takes more photos for work and needs to pull off 300 GB of photos and the DCIM folder refuses to show up on the same computer that works with a different iPhone. So, none of the actual computer suggestions are the issue because another phone works. We have tried everything on the iPhone side like turning off shared folders in iCloud, making sure originals are on the phone, resetting privacy settings, right clicking on iPhone, tried multiple cords, reinstalled itunes, used apple devices, redid drivers, etc. Everything. Is there anything that is missing that I could try? Why would one phone work and the other phone not work? I feel sometimes when you design software to be idiot proof, you write idiotic software. This is definitely one example of that which infuriates me with Apple. Actually, this should be lawsuit material trying to force users to buy cloud software that has week security in order to access your own intellectual property on the phone.\"",

Last week my father in-law took his own life and left both his iPad and iPhone along with his Apple ID password (among all of his access to everything else) But he did delete all of his messages/photos/call logs essentially wiping his devices before he left us. Even deleted them from the trash. We have tried restoring from iCloud backups but the only available  backup was after his passing. Our family is desperately seeking answers and would love to know if there was any messages to/from anyone or any photos that would leave any clues. Is there ANY way of getting access to messages or photos that have been deleted from the devices? ",

        "post_text": "Are iPhones 13 a bad model? Is there a bug in the new iOS causing glitches? I'm not looking for technical support but I'd like to know if I need an exorcist at this point. \n\nAfter all these happy years together, my beloved iPhone 8 Plus has been crashing way too often so I thought it has time. A new model was needed. With a broken heart I checked and an iPhone 13 seemed a good alternative; so I finally made the decision and bought one 2 weeks ago. For the first time in the least decade, I regretted buying an Apple product. Still cannot believe I'm saying this. But the connectivity glitches have been a daily routine since. \n\nIt started already when setting the phone. Completely wiping out my Watch and having to restart the pairing. Took almsot 24h but in the end the watch seem to be itself again. Same with backing up my messenger apps between the old and new phone. Always having to try twice to get it done. Since them, it has continued with weird things, from the Airdrop suddenly not working to the WiFi connection being dropped (while other devices have it on) and then other devices trying to connect to a Hotspot that was OFF when loosing it themselves on a different time. Before this, I didn't think I had a faulty WiFi, but we have taken a look at that as well just to be sure. Any case, it seemed time to call the profesionals. After several HOURS in conversations over the weekend with Apple Support (different chats and calls got disconnected), the conclusion was inevitable: return the phone. And so I did. \n\nAfter resetting my old reliable iPhone 8Plus (so glad I didn‚Äôt give it away!), glitchy phone was returned and a new unit was purchased. That was yesterday and since then I have been slowly setting it up to avoid any problems. I started with my Watch yesterday. And this time it seem to work‚Ä¶ until tonight, when I put it to charge and several hours later realized it wasn‚Äôt. Checked connections, changed cables and finally restarted the device which seems to finally be charging. \n\nSo now I‚Äôm wondering: it‚Äôs the new iOS or the phone? Are iPhone 13 cursed and I missed the memo? Has Apple quality dropped to this point? I have been regularly buying their products precisely because of how reliable they have all been. No problems, just steady and quality. Is it gone now? Is it me? I‚Äôm starting to reconsider all because I don‚Äôt know what going on. And neither did Apple Support for what it matters. So here I am asking the ultimate resource: Reddit. Please, do your magic. What your opinion here: do I sent someone to fetch the priest?\n\nTL;DR: My new iPhone seems cursed and now my other poor devices (loyal all these past years) keep struggling somehow too.",

It‚Äôs hard to recreate since it‚Äôs usually when I take my lunch in my hot car. I haven‚Äôt been able to get a picture yet so I traced the lines and it‚Äôs pretty much accurate including the colour. It‚Äôs like a pattern similar to this [ ________ ] across the screen and repeats down the screen too \n\nHere‚Äôs the pic I drew: \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/CMrhNpc.jpeg\n\nWhen I closed apps the ‚Äúburnt‚Äù lines would move or glitch and sometimes go away. As well, when I open some apps the horizontal lines would curve at the sides. I think it‚Äôs a software issue I haven‚Äôt seen anyone talk about this. \n\nWhat is going on?",

We never had an MDM for these devices ‚Ä¶ users could keep them when they left , lots broken , lost ect ect‚Ä¶ \n\nNot all of these old devices were logged properly when people left. But they are on Apple Business Manager \n\nWe are now getting a new phone provider and we are going to be getting the new iPhones linked straight into intune so that won‚Äôt be a problem .\n\nHowever , as for the old devices ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think my company really cares about them but what is the best course of action here? Let‚Äôs say we have an iPhone 8 from 2019 what happens if we accidentally set up an MDM for it and it now is being used by someone outside the business? \n\nAlso does an already bought phone need to be wiped before MDM can happen?\n\nJust confused on what could happen üòÇ",

Well I just noticed that all of my iMessages before Dec. 2023 are gone. Even with them being \"back up\" and me having my settings set to always save messages.  I have no idea what happene. Called Apple to see if I can get them back, they did another reset and now I can only see messages from May this year. I was planning on using text conversations for my custody case, what do I do now ? \nThe phone was backed up, but where the heck did it go?? Are they really all gone?",

Your Mac should have a Messages app, log in with your iCloud account and see if it will sync your missing messages. It will depend on how much storage your Mac has and how big your iCloud message backup is.

I was told it was a iPhone 14 pro max, But it's an 11 Pro Max. That's fine, but since I was scammed I was worried about the possibility of having some kind of spyware on it. I've done three factory resets, but when I looked on Google it said that factory resets won't get rid of something called a rootkit virus. Is there a way I can check for that? Is there a way just to know that it's safe to use that phone, because my old phone barely works And I just want to use the iPhone. \n\nSorry if that didn't make much sense, I don't know anything about Tech. But I'm scared to enter in any apps or account details if it's being hacked.",

I think the main reason I'm paranoid is I put my SIM card in that iPhone once I got it, and then paniced and put it back in my Samsung. And I can't tell if I'm being paranoid or not but every now and then early in the morning when I'm asleep not all my phone, I'll get a notification from my antivirus software that data restore tool is safe. And I only get those notifications when something updates or opens, and I check and they didn't update. So I'm wondering if that means my phone is being remotely accessed because I put the SIM card in that other phone for a day, or because they somehow remotely accessed my current Samsung phone. Sorry I'm so paranoid and I hope what I said makes sense.",

But it was shared by someone who is not the person about the phone from, completely different person. But the odds of that map showing that specific small area make me terrify that means I'm being spied on and watched, and hacked.",

I think the main reason I'm paranoid is I put my SIM card in that iPhone once I got it, and then paniced and put it back in my Samsung. And I can't tell if I'm being paranoid or not but every now and then early in the morning when I'm asleep not all my phone, I'll get a notification from my antivirus software that data restore tool is safe. And I only get those notifications when something updates or opens, and I check and they didn't update. So I'm wondering if that means my phone is being remotely accessed because I put the SIM card in that other phone for a day, or because they somehow remotely accessed my current Samsung phone. Sorry I'm so paranoid and I hope what I said makes sense.",

Remember that your phone only stores the low res versions of photos if you have ‚ÄòOptimize iPhone Storage‚Äô enabled in Photos settings.

        "post_text": "WhatsApp and iOS backup\n\nHi guys,\n\nI got 50GB iCloud+, 46GB used. I noticed that iPhone backups take 20GB, from which 19,45GB are from WhatsApp. \n\nHowever, when I go to iCloud+ settings, I see the 20GB from backups PLUS 10,2 GB from WhatsApp Messenger. When I go to WhatsApp Settings > Backup, the backup size is 10,23GB.\n\nMy question is: What is exactly being backed up from WhatsApp in the whole iPhone backup? Am I backing up twice the messages?\n\nI would like to make some space, so it would be cool if I‚Äôm right and I could disable iPhone backup for WhatsApp, and let the in-app setting enabled (or vice versa)\n\nThanks!!",
