I took all the 1001 tips found on apple communities, google, youtube. All of them don’t work. I can install new apps from the app store without issues and the phone syncs with the iCloud. I hope for one miracle solution that does work. Who is my hero.",

Settings in Numering convention, Calendar and what not - Time Zone can be left automatic, which will default to whatever country you may be - but everything else possible MUST be Enlgish-USA instead of any other country or language)\n\n- rejoin your wifi (AFTER your device activated - as the apps will download only through your Wifi home internet)\n\nUnder those settings and following the steps as described, we've gotten the default apps downloaded without problems.\n\nIf you are still stuck, then you might as well try again using the above settings. After all the default apps have downloaded, you can then go back into Settings and change the device's language to whichever is that you prefer as well as change the country in the 'region' section as well (BUT NOT BEFORE the default apps complete their download - if you don't follow this, you will get stuck again).\n\nEdit: **App for the MAC in bold text** (if using Mac) or itunes if using PC (alternative Windows Pcs have recently also received an App as well, available on the Microsoft Store)",

In such case - Apple support may tell you you need to re-install iOS on your device (using your Mac -- i won't use the 'other' Mac Competitor name ; ).\n\nThe good news is that you are in contact with apple support, though I would strongly encourage you to set a call with them and have them troubleshoot on the phone with you the issue with your device.",

I replaced it for a new 15 Pro Max so the 11 backup was successfully restored to the 15 and the 11 was factory reset but still had 17.5.1 as IOS. I did read all your suggestions and it is appreciated but there is no iTunes for MacOS Sonoma 14.5. iTunes was discontinued. So if you are lucky and you own a PC or Mac with iTunes on it then your steps should probably work. I don't deny that. But I don't have the luck that I have an old install of iTunes somewhere on a machine.",

I did read all your suggestions and it is appreciated but there is no iTunes for MacOS Sonoma 14.5. iTunes was discontinued. So if you are lucky and you own a PC or Mac with iTunes on it then your steps should probably work. I don't deny that. But I don't have the luck that I have an old install of iTunes somewhere on a machine.",

I did read all your suggestions and it is appreciated but there is no iTunes for MacOS Sonoma 14.5. iTunes was discontinued. So if you are lucky and you own a PC or Mac with iTunes on it then your steps should probably work. I don't deny that.

Depending on those results, then you can decide what to do next.\n\nEdit: **App for the MAC in bold text** (if using Mac) or itunes if using PC (alternative Windows Pcs have recently also received an App as well, available on the Microsoft Store)",

I replaced it for a new 15 Pro Max so the 11 backup was successfully restored to the 15 and the 11 was factory reset but still had 17.5.1 as IOS. I did read all your suggestions and it is appreciated but there is no iTunes for MacOS Sonoma 14.5. iTunes was discontinued. So if you are lucky and you own a PC or Mac with iTunes on it then your steps should probably work. I don't deny that. But I don't have the luck that I have an old install of iTunes somewhere on a machine.",

In such case - Apple support may tell you you need to re-install iOS on your device (using your Mac -- i won't use the 'other' Mac Competitor name ; ).\n\nThe good news is that you are in contact with apple support, though I would strongly encourage you to set a call with them and have them troubleshoot on the phone with you the issue with your device.",

I did read all your suggestions and it is appreciated but there is no iTunes for MacOS Sonoma 14.5. iTunes was discontinued. So if you are lucky and you own a PC or Mac with iTunes on it then your steps should probably work. I don't deny that. But I don't have the luck that I have an old install of iTunes somewhere on a machine.",

In such case - Apple support may tell you you need to re-install iOS on your device (using your Mac -- i won't use the 'other' Mac Competitor name ; ).\n\nThe good news is that you are in contact with apple support, though I would strongly encourage you to set a call with them and have them troubleshoot on the phone with you the issue with your device.",

I did read all your suggestions and it is appreciated but there is no iTunes for MacOS Sonoma 14.5. iTunes was discontinued. So if you are lucky and you own a PC or Mac with iTunes on it then your steps should probably work. I don't deny that.

In such case - Apple support may tell you you need to re-install iOS on your device (using your Mac -- i won't use the 'other' Mac Competitor name ; ).\n\nThe good news is that you are in contact with apple support, though I would strongly encourage you to set a call with them and have them troubleshoot on the phone with you the issue with your device.",

I replaced it for a new 15 Pro Max so the 11 backup was successfully restored to the 15 and the 11 was factory reset but still had 17.5.1 as IOS. I did read all your suggestions and it is appreciated but there is no iTunes for MacOS Sonoma 14.5. iTunes was discontinued. So if you are lucky and you own a PC or Mac with iTunes on it then your steps should probably work. I don't deny that. But I don't have the luck that I have an old install of iTunes somewhere on a machine.",

In such case - Apple support may tell you you need to re-install iOS on your device (using your Mac -- i won't use the 'other' Mac Competitor name ; ).\n\nThe good news is that you are in contact with apple support, though I would strongly encourage you to set a call with them and have them troubleshoot on the phone with you the issue with your device.",

I replaced it for a new 15 Pro Max so the 11 backup was successfully restored to the 15 and the 11 was factory reset but still had 17.5.1 as IOS. I did read all your suggestions and it is appreciated but there is no iTunes for MacOS Sonoma 14.5. iTunes was discontinued. So if you are lucky and you own a PC or Mac with iTunes on it then your steps should probably work. I don't deny that. But I don't have the luck that I have an old install of iTunes somewhere on a machine.",

In such case - Apple support may tell you you need to re-install iOS on your device (using your Mac -- i won't use the 'other' Mac Competitor name ; ).\n\nThe good news is that you are in contact with apple support, though I would strongly encourage you to set a call with them and have them troubleshoot on the phone with you the issue with your device.",

I did read all your suggestions and it is appreciated but there is no iTunes for MacOS Sonoma 14.5. iTunes was discontinued. So if you are lucky and you own a PC or Mac with iTunes on it then your steps should probably work. I don't deny that.

In such case - Apple support may tell you you need to re-install iOS on your device (using your Mac -- i won't use the 'other' Mac Competitor name ; ).\n\nThe good news is that you are in contact with apple support, though I would strongly encourage you to set a call with them and have them troubleshoot on the phone with you the issue with your device.",

In such case - Apple support may tell you you need to re-install iOS on your device (using your Mac -- i won't use the 'other' Mac Competitor name ; ).\n\nThe good news is that you are in contact with apple support, though I would strongly encourage you to set a call with them and have them troubleshoot on the phone with you the issue with your device.",

So I just change the alias, add a \"1\" into the alias or whatever the next number is, then close the exposed alias email, real email never exposed and whatever spam that was coming my way is gone\n\nIf the secondary email is in a breach, then I create a new email and replace the accounts with that email with the new email. It's still a good amount to have to change but nowhere near the amount of aliases I use\n\nAliasing is a better spam filter than any email provider's spam filter, unless the specific email you use is meant to be public, such as on your own website or something like that",

At first, you would think you can use the Finder app on your MacBook, open your iPhone and navigate to the Files tab, open the app's folder and transfer footage from the Media folder. But you can't even see what's in the Media folder 🤦‍♂️.\n\n[useless Finder app](https://preview.redd.it/wzzl0sj6zt6d1.png?width=1332&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f6ec1395f757b6212123b33fe8c661e1d274784)\n\n2. You would think you could then use the fact that the iPhone 15 Pro has USB 3 and share the footage from the Blackmagic Cam app using \"AirDrop\" and that it would be smart enough to detect the wired connection to send the files through the cable instead of through the \"air\" but no, it does exactly what the name says; it'll try to remotely transfer the files from the iPhone to the MacBook even though they're both wired together 🤦‍♂️.\n\n3. \"Perhaps it'll work this time if I save the footage to another folder on my iPhone's storage\"; So you create a new folder \"Footage\" on your phone's storage and now set the Blackmagic Cam app to write to that folder expecting it to be visible in the Finder's Files tab of your Mac, but no! the folder doesn't even show up 🤦‍♂️.\n\n  \nPlease tell me I just missed something, because not being able to transfer files from your phone to your laptop in 2024 while they're about to launch \"Apple Intelligence\" is scary...\n\nPS: I do not want to write to the Photos app of the iPhone.",
