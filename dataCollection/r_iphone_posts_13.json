        "post_text": "So here is one annoying thing. I have two devices, one android and other is iOS device (15 pm) running  17.4. I have my work SIM on android device and i uses its hotspot for my iOS device to stay connected. \n\nHowever whenever i lock my iOS device, it disconnects from the hotspot until i unlock it. No matter what, it never stays connected with the hotspot. Its like it knows it is connected to a hotspot so it disconnects. Because of this, i miss my emails, WhatsApp calls and messages. As soon as i unlock the device, im bombarded with the notifications which were never delivered since my device was apparently offline. \n\nNow this never happens with the home WiFi. Device  always stays connected. It only happens with the hotspot. \n\nI thought it might be the hotspot on android device which might be turning off but i have kept it on always on.  \n\nIs this a bug because this doesn’t seem normal to me. Or is there a setting i need to change so it stays connected with the hotspot?\n\nThanks",

Unfortunately a few years ago I found out I was queer and have to hide it from them. I managed to hide it from them so far and am now in college. \n\nThe thing is I need to buy procreate for my class. I have a payment method that works after asking my friend to try it out for me. I just don’t have a way to purchase it at the moment because I’m on family sharing and need permission to purchase. \n\nLuckily I have access to my dad’s phone and he is the organizer. I was just wondering if a notification would be sent if I turned off family sharing. I just don’t want my parents to find out I bought procreate cause that means they’ll regularly ask to see the contents of the app and I don’t want to delete any of my art just because I fear they might see it.

I also pay for iCloud+, so all my photos are synced to the cloud as well.\n\nLast week I found out that all my 2023 photos were missing, both on my iCloud and locally. This was really strange since I made no changes, nor deleted any photos recently and photos sync shows up to date.  I really panicked,because last year we made a very memorable trip to Washington and took many photos. I Checked on iCloud from my PC and they were also gone. I thought the photos were gone for good until today I found, miraculously, a really old iPhone 6s I had previously which was last synced on March. It still has all the missing 2023 photos, so my first thought was to immediately turn off iCloud sync so they wouldn’t auto delete. Now I need some advice on how can I proceed to save the missing photos.\n\nI tried connecting the iPhone via USB and using iTunes but when syncing finishes it is still missing all the 2023 photos and just downloads the most up to date photos stored in iCloud.\n\npd. Sorry for my bad English. This is not my first language. I really appreciate if you guys could shed some light on this matter.",

I looked up the problem, and see that other people experiencing the same issue have had their phones work for a short amount of time then crash again. I'd like to know how I can back my phone up as quickly as possible, in case this happens for me.\n\nTheres about 64 gb of data on my phone ( minus however much the updates take up, which is probably a lot). Roughly half of it is in camera roll, I'm not sure why so much, I dont have that many videos, but I guess all my pictures add up. I only have the free 5GB of icloud storage so my phone hasn't backed up through icloud in a long time.   \n  \nI've tried recently to download my photos to a computer but it just didnt work, the photos app on my PC and laptop would just infinitely say they had sent a request to my phone but nothing would show up. So I'm not sure I'll be able to upload stuff manually like that.   \nI'd really like to save my saved passwords, contacts, and some photos, but am not sure what the fastest way to do that will be - assuming I have a short window of opportunity to use my phone.\n\nThanks.",

I researched solutions for him on my phone, but, irrationally, most suggested solutions that required him to be able to see his screen (plus, more logically, reboot phone). Another friend suggested to simply ask Siri to \"brighten screen.\" THIS WORKED! It seems weird this obvious, and easy, solution is not at the top of all the lists of ways to fix this problem. Maybe I just did not dig down deep enough in the search results.",

For at least 10 or so months I've been having this problem where I'm driving and my Apple Maps (or Waze or whatever else I'm using) will lag, say I'm facing the wrong direction, or say that my location is not on the road. It will intermittently fix itself and fail again a couple minutes later. Usually I can use the written directions to get where I'm going, but I miss turns a lot. My new job requires a lot of traveling and I need this to stop happening. \n\nAt first I thought it was my old phone (iPhone XR) because it was damaged. So my boyfriend gave me his XR and turns out it's giving me the same problem. Then, I had my sister use her phone's GPS (iPhone 11) today on my way to buy a new iPhone 12, and we were still having the same problem (I didn't end up buying a new phone). \n\nMy boyfriend can still see my location update even when all of this is happening. I drive a Mazda 6 2014 and my carrier is MetroPCS, if that matters. Is anyone else having this problem?? Is there a fix? I've tried turning my phone on and off, resetting location settings, and making sure all location settings are correct as per the Apple website's help page. ",
