        "post_text": "Today I decided to leave my phone charging overnight. I woke up to it being unresponsive. After a while it started working again after I connected the charger and asked Siri to turn up brightness.\n\nDoes anybody know what the issue is? I run the latest iOS version (17.5.1). The phone is in use for less than 2 weeks. Manufactured in September 2023. No damage that I know of (highly unlikely). I did get into a slight drizzle yesterday, but the water damage marker in the SIM card slot is fine. I never got any warnings about anything.\n\nIs this something I should be concerned about? If I return this phone I won’t get it replaced in my country, so please tell me it’s not a hardware issue.\n\nI did check Google and Reddit extensively, but it seems that it’s not that much talked about even though people have been having issues since iPhone X. Many posts are outdated and only tell you how to get out of this state through pressing some buttons. I only found one post of a person suspecting that it has to do something with the screen and its panel, either a measure to prevent damage from overcharging or a bug. As far as I can tell Apple didn’t address this issue and nobody ever figured out what it is?",

Unless it keeps happening it's most likely just software. If it really keeps misbehaving in odd ways you might have received a defective unit but then you'd likely notice it or it will just die altogether.",

I couldn’t believe it.\n\n Is it not possible to just ignore the back glass and replace just the screen and keeping my data? \n",

The iMessages weren't deleted in this instance. \n\nMore context: Person A and Person B share their locations with each other indefinitely. Person A got a notification that Person B had stopped sharing their location, and Person B is saying they have no idea how this happened. Are there other explanations, or is Person B lying?",

This morning after my alarms went off, I grabbed my phone which was fully charged, snoozed my alarms and then eight minutes later, they didn't go off. I grabbed my phone to see what was going on. It wasn't dead and was overheating. \n\nSeeing this I did a force restart and upon the restart completing, I typed in my passcode and my phone rebooted. However, it sat on the spinning icon for multiple minutes before restarting. Once it restarted I was able to get past the lock screen by entering my passcode, then when scrolling through pages of apps, the apps did not display. After this bug displayed, my phone restarted again. \n\nI forced a restart, got past the lock screen once more and was able to scroll to the App Library where all apps were displayed but with no app icons. I swiped away from the App Library and back once more and the icons appeared. \n\nI've been able to use my phone normally today but realized that messaging, spotlight, and more are reindexing on my phone. I'm being asked to re-enter my iCloud password and it seems to me that my phone has been partially reset or a necessary cache was cleared. \n\nWhat's strange, a friend of mine dealt with this issue around the same time yesterday morning. Coincidentally, I'm dealing with the same issue today.\n\nHas anyone dealt with this previously? If so, did anything lead to the issue or did you have any problems after this happened? Anything helps!",

I've got an iphone, don't know the model, on t-mobile that I inherited from my dad last year.  I THOUGHT it was on the find my app that my mom has on hers.\n\nToday I know I had it when I went to get some dinner.  I sent a friend a message I THOUGHT after I'd rolled the windows up (since I took a photo after I left the line, and am pretty sure that like normal I rolled it up immediately after I got out of the line), and about an hour ago (after not remembering getting it out of my purse at any point) when I grabbed for my purse to put the phone on the charger noticed that I couldn't find it.  Nor can I find it in the car, in my bed, or anywhere else I've been since I got home.\n\nCalling won't work because I leave the switch off (can't have it on at work and I always forget it) and it's not on her find me app.  I tried clicking the + button, but either it is out of range, or doesn't have the location whatever turned on because the app just said to follow the instructions to add it to the app.  Which I can't do when the phone is not in my hand.\n\nSo far as I know they don't have an icloud account, and I don't have access to any of the settings stuff because I haven't ever figured out how to get my info onto it instead of his.\n\nIs there anything I can do to find it?",

I periodically move all photos onto my PC (and back up onto hard drives) to keep iPhone memory free. \n\nIf I just plug iPhone into PC via USB I only get date albums, can't see phone albums. \n\nI have tried logging into iCloud (internet) and downloading the photos from there but this takes an incredibly long time, it is often stuck on loading for hours and I give up. \n\nI have purchased Copy Trans and whilst this does work (shows photos in iPhone albums) it takes forever to download the photos. Some albums will have 600 photos in them by the time I back them up, this can take 3 hours per album. Still quicker than iCloud website. \n\nI have not yet tried iCloud for Windows because from what I have read online it seems it just syncs the photos, it doesn't download them? I don't want exactly the same problem I have with CopyTrans where I go to copy and paste them to another PC album just for it to tell me they aren't downloaded yet. Does anyone use this method and can you give me some more information as to how it works please?\n\nIf anyone has any other ideas I'd be very appreciative. \nThank you. ",

He has a hard time sleeping during the day. \n\nWe always send each other a good morning text, but if he has managed to fall asleep, I don’t want the notification to wake him up.  But I still want to send him his good morning text when I wake up.\n\n  Is there a way on my end to silence my text so he doesn’t get a notification until he looks at his phone once he has woken up?\n\n  He can’t put his phone on Do Not Disturb in case work calls or has an issue that he needs to address. \n\nAny suggestions or is there a feature that I haven’t figured out that will help? Thanks in advance! ",

I assumed it was just my provider disconnecting me because i already spend all of my prepaid data and it was about to update tommorow. After i came home i noticed that neither our wifi worked. It wouldnt even show the curved stripes that signal ur connected just nothing. Only in settings i could see that i was connecting but still no internet. I tried EVERYTHING. I restarted the phone, I resetted all of the settings, i even erased the whole phone but still nothing. Help would be grately appreciated. And also i didnt find anyone else having the same problem.",

        "post_text": "My iPhone 13 (17.2.1) won't connect to wifi or cell data. I followed the steps in the article below (including resetting network settings) but still no luck. My wifi says \"no internet connection\" underneath the network name. My other devices are connecting to wifi ok. Can anyone help? thanks\n\n[https://support.apple.com/en-us/111786](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111786)\n\n  \nEdit: Now updated to 7.5.1 - issue persists\n\n\nEdit 2 (day 2): issues seems to have resolved itself. Was in the process of updating OSX in order to backup the phone before erasing. Didn't need to in the end. Kept resetting router as WiFi speed was low also. Suddenly both WiFi and data started working again. It felt like an issue with the line and/or/combination of cell provider. Can't put my finger on it. ",

I then checked my iCloud online and it was still showing all of the photos including the ones I deleted. \nI did some searching/googling etc, and went into my settings to make sure iCloud sync was on, and made sure the toggle was on for photos, as this is what Google suggested. Closed out of everything and still the same. 20,000 photos on phone, 30,000 on iCloud and still saying full. \n\nI then toggled photos off then back on, and toggled sync off then back on. \n\nThen all the photos off my phone were wiped, and are now redownloading from iCloud and so did the 10,000 photos I deleted 😭\n\nSo I wasted so much time for nothing. \n\nI don’t know how to make sure the photos I delete from my phone also delete from iCloud. \n\nEdited to add: I did also make sure to dwelt the photos from recently deleted and then checked iCloud again, and still they didn’t delete. They are now all back. \nDoes anyone know how I can resolve this? Thanks. ",

Unbeknownst to me, one of the people in there I found out is really not to be trusted and the photo could get us in slight trouble if someone decided to use it that way. I am basically wondering if there is a way to have this person not be able to see the photo anymore or to delete it in the group chat maybe if the creator were to delete it? I know the unsend is definitely expired. \n\nAny thoughts on a way to get it out of there or do I just take the loss on this one and be more careful in the future?",

The quick start migration process using direct WiFi should last about 5h … but always fails after about 90min.  \n\nI tried about 20times to migrate my phone to the replacement one. What is driving me nuts: if I move the phones closely together the banner to support quick start migration appears. But only once!\n\nIf I want a second (or 10th) run… I have to reboot my phone. And I’ve rebooted my iPhone more times during the last 3days since the all those years since 2008. \n\nOr is there another option to force the quick start migration banner to re-appear after one try?\n\nThank you!\n\n\n",

The rear glass and camera lens are fused together and technically is not replaceable so they basically transfer the guts to a whole new rear shell. \n\nSome third party shops can laser off the old rear glass and put an aftermarket glass piece on. You may or may not have problems in the future with a trade in as it was not repaired properly and waterproofing may not be as good.",

Of course you can heat it up but the trickiest part is prying of the remaining glass pieces. Best what you can do to not accidentally damage the camera when prying is to remove the camera (which means you have to remove display and the tape that is used to prevent water and dust from coming in. When you are done with that you’ll need to glue the new glass and try to clean up remainings of the glue from the inside. It will rarely be as strong as out of factory.\n\nEDIT: in addition I would say if you have never done repairs on phones or other small devices I would probably not recommend doing so in order to prevent further damage. If you are willing to take the risk, know that you need to have a lot of patience and good tooling.",

Of course you can heat it up but the trickiest part is prying of the remaining glass pieces. Best what you can do to not accidentally damage the camera when prying is to remove the camera (which means you have to remove display and the tape that is used to prevent water and dust from coming in. When you are done with that you’ll need to glue the new glass and try to clean up remainings of the glue from the inside. It will rarely be as strong as out of factory.\n\nEDIT: in addition I would say if you have never done repairs on phones or other small devices I would probably not recommend doing so in order to prevent further damage. If you are willing to take the risk, know that you need to have a lot of patience and good tooling.",
