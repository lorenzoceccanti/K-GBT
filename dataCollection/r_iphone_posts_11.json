        "post_text": "i've had my iphone 11 for about 3 years and at some point i just stopped updating it due to never having enough storage to do so, also kinda forgot, so i'm on ios 15.6.1 and i keep getting notifications about upgrading to 17.5.1. like ill get popups when using my phone about updating and when i click later, it tries to schedule an automatic update when connected to power at a certain time in the morning and ive delayed it for a couple days and it keeps lengthening the time window that itll update in when i have it charging. i was just wondering if it would be safe to update it since it's such a jump in versions, like i know the upgraded home screen with the new layout was multiple updates ago maybe and i dont even have that yet. i'm worried ir could break my phone or something, and i won't be able to back up my photos at least due to not enough icloud storage. equally i'm scared that it might reset or clear the cache on my apps for social media accounts that ngl i dont remember the password for. is it fine to let it update?",

You'll also stay logged in to all your apps and social networks.\nYour phone might get slower though as iOS 17 is more resource intensive than 15.\n\nIn my opinion iOS 15 was the last stable version as both 16 and 17 have given me tons of problems. So as long as you are aware of the security voulnrabilites of staying on such old software, my suggestion would be to wait for the iOS 18 update.",

        "post_text": "Recently my notes app just stopped working. No clue why or how, but it randomly closed on me and now I can’t open it again. I tried restarting my phone, offloading and reinstalling the notes app, unsyncing and resyncing my notes, sending messages from my texts to the notes app to force open it(which it won’t even let me do anymore), and even asking Siri to force me into the app. I can’t force close the app because after I open it, it keeps force closing itself. I understand my phone is old and maybe I don’t update it enough(i tend to ignore updates, I updated a year and a half ago from 1.14 straight to 1.16 and don’t remember the least time I updated again). Can anyone tell me what could the problem be? This is a iPhone 8 btw, if that at all effects the problem.",

        "post_text": "I needed a new iPhone after my iPhone 7 terminally failed. It was overdue but I didn’t have $1k to spare. So I went to back market online to replace my dead fossil. I used them to buy a refurb laptop recently and it was great.\n\nIt wasn’t so great when I opened the box on a iPhone 13 Plus Max. First reaction was that all corners of the phone were scratched up. Badly. When I turned it on the settings screen had an alert—not a genuine Apple display! The message warned me of potential problems. Maybe this is an Apple scare tactic but if so it worked.\n\nSo the back market return procedure is so complex, poorly described and demanding, that it truly seems like an intentional discouragement. And the shipping return goes directly to the refurbisher who I expect is going to do everything possible to shutdown a refund.\n\nIt requires no less than 7 pictures of the device, and I don’t understand how a phone can take photos of itself? The process takes three screens of directions on my desktop monitor!\n\nThe problem is essentially due to the hands off business model of back market. The products offered on the BM site are not in the hands of the BM staff. They are listings from independent refurbished. BM collects the price, collects their cut and sends the refurbisher what’s left. They probably already listed by purchase as profit.\n\nCall BM support and they simply tell you to manage the process yourself on their website. “Thanks a lot” for the lousy service, back market. I guess it’s my $700 mistake now. Never again.\n",

This \"works\", but since it saves to computer's file system (and the external SSD) via the network and not through a USB connection, it is very slow and drops frame rates.\n* Connecting via USB. It's very easy to [see the File System of the iPhone on the MacBook](https://support.apple.com/en-us/119585), but very difficult the other way around. I have not seen any applications that allow you to see the File System of the MacBook on the iPhone.\n* Streaming content directly to the computer using software (i.e. [OBS](https://obsproject.com)), and another iOS application (i.e. [iOS Camera for OBS Studio](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/camera-for-obs-studio/id1352834008&ved=2ahUKEwi9-tS28dOGAxX_FzQIHUn4DeQQFnoECB8QAQ&usg=AOvVaw3zigJLb0cB6WSyeJwU7lLh)), but that over heats my iPhone very quickly (causing it to stop recording while it cools down), and it loses quality verses using a video recording app like BlackMagic Camera.\n\nWhat are some ways I can accomplish this task?\n\nThanks!",

I’ve contacted Apple Support, they told me it was because of a financial situation but they can’t look further than that nor can they reverse the blockage. I’ve tried creating a new ID instantly blocked as well. My question is if I buy a new phone and put my SD card in it will it block me from making a brand new Apple ID? ",

With apple pay, what information is actually sent to an online merchant? \n\nI made an online purchase yesterday (a VPN subscription), but the Apple Pay only had my card details. Usually when I buy online, I can see my name, address, email, etc. So I am not sure which information has been sent to the merchant in this case? \n\nIs it just my name, and billing address? Is even billing address sent to the merchant via apple pay if it is encrypted. \n\nI am just confused as usually, I can see or change the information being sent to the merchant. This time, there was nothing present, not even the billing address, just the card I wanted to use for payment... \n\n",

It shares the same Apple ID/iCloud with my current iPhone. Settings are also almost identical including some messaging apps. But, the lost phone has Find My turned off. Original SIM from the old country was still in there when lost but roaming is off too. \n\nI can’t find it on iCloud/find map. It doesn’t show up. I can see it under my Apple ID in the settings, listed as one of my devices. I can see serial number and IMEI and all. \n\nWhat should I do in this situation?\nIs there a way to track the phone?\nI can’t seem to even turn on Lost Mode. \n\nThanks in advance!🙏",

Realistically, you're probably out of luck, whoever finds the phone will reset it and enjoy their new phone.\n\nMaybe you'll get lucky and they'll try to reach you, but without a working SIM your odds of anyone jumping through the additional hoops go way down.",

In doing this, I came across one phone that would not let me download the Google photos app. The phone did have airdrop, so I (thought) airdropped the photos to my current phone, relying on the automatic Google sync, then deleted them from the old phone. This was about 3 months ago. Tonight I plugged in the phone to finish uploading, and I noticed the airdrop failed, so they didn’t get uploaded, and the photos are gone from the recently deleted folder. Is there any way at all I can get these back? These were all the photos of memories from my high school, I am sick to my stomach. Does Apple keep these anywhere? Is there any hope???",

        "post_text": "My girlfriend and I share our locations with each other but today I received a notification in our chat that said, “You stopped sharing location with (gf name)”. I got the notification at 5pm and when I asked why she stopped sharing her location she said I removed her contact from the shared location list and sent a screenshot of our chat with the same notification “You stopped sharing location with (my name)” that she received at 1pm but I can’t see it on my phone. The thing is I never stopped sharing my location, I have no problem with it, but she insists I manually went into the app and removed her contact. Last night I asked my girlfriend about her odd locations while she was drunk in the passenger seat driving around with her friend so when our locations stop sharing the next day it raises an alarm. Can anyone tell me if there’s some kind of glitch or oversight cause it’s either that or my girlfriend is gaslighting me into oblivion and she stopped sharing her location earlier. Thank you\n\n\nTDLR: Received notification at 5pm saying I stopped sharing location with girlfriend. Girlfriend sent a screenshot of the same notification on her phone from 1pm and insists I stopped sharing my location so she did the same at 5pm. I never stopped sharing my location in over a year. This comes a day after I asked about her strange locations while she had been drinking. Is my girlfriend just blatantly lying or could there be a glitch or oversight? Dm if you need screenshot for clarity \n",

I don’t see anyone getting a warning that its been turned off from memory. Get her to show you the message in person, not a screenshot. Then i would honestly just accept it as truth. Though her turning off her instead of asking why you turned off yours was strange. \n\nIf i suddenly got a message that my partner turned off his I’d be straight on the phone asking why.",

        "post_text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm facing a serious issue and I'm hoping someone here can offer a viable solution. I recently switched from an iPhone to an Android device, and I'm trying to transfer all my WhatsApp chats. So far, so good, but the huge problem is that my WhatsApp backup file in iCloud is over 80GB.\n\nI've tried several options, but all the guides and tools I've found don't seem to handle a file of this size. Additionally, I don't want to lose any important chats or attachments. Here are some additional details that might be helpful:\n\n* I have enough storage space on my new Android device.\n* I've already tried using the official WhatsApp transfer method, but it seems it can't handle the file size.\n* I've seen some third-party tools, but I'm concerned about their security and effectiveness.\n\nHas anyone else gone through something similar or have any suggestions on how I can transfer my chats without losing anything in the process? Any advice, tools, or guides would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",
