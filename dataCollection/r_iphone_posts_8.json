We have 7 devices between the four family members, using the same Apple ID and subscribed to Apple One Family.\n\nI have a small collection of music, mostly ripped from niche vinyl years ago, stored in Apple Music somewhere on the cloud. I’d like to be able to retrieve these, and put them onto a new Apple ID. \n\nSecondly & most importantly my two children’s devices (as are mine and my ex’s) all use find my phone, and I would like the ability to get able to still see this info on a new ID, but not my ex’s for obvious reasons. Would this be possible? I know you can use a find my friends feature but I always thought this was a temporary thing (find a mate at a concert etc). \n\nThank you for any advice or information if at all possible ",

It was helpful to “text them” when blocked to process my feelings about them ghosting after a 2yr relationship on my birthday. If it’s a glitch and I’m not blocked I don’t want to be texting them. If I am blocked, it was a really helpful processing tool I don’t want to lose. \n\nTIA! Please be kind/gentle. ",

If I do that:  \n  \n- Would the remaining AppleCare+ time remain attached to the device?  \n- Would it be lost?  \n- Could I transfer it to my new device? ",

        "post_text": "Hello! I have an iPhone SE 2020. Recently my phone’s storage was full and most apps started lagging. All of my notes that were stored on my iPhone have disappeared.  At first nothing would open on the notes app, it was blank and then the iCloud folder showed up but none of the notes stored on my iPhone are visible. \n\nAny way I can revive them? These are years of notes, some copied from older phones :(\n\nThank you!  ",

        "post_text": "Hello everyone, I hope you're all doing great. Let me start by saying I've got an iPhone SE (2022), which was bought in early January 2023. The thing is that since February last year the phone started having intermittent issues with the touch screen. I mean, I sometimes have to tap the screen twice or three times to open an app, or simply when I’m navigating on settings or in any other app I find that at times I have to tap the touch screen twice or three times for it to register the touch/tap.\n\nEven when I am on Grindr, I’ve noticed the screen scrolls up a bit by itself. The phone had a Hydrogel screen protector, which I thought was the issue. However, I already removed it and I'm currently using the phone without an screen protector and the issue still persists.\n\nAbout three days ago I took it to an AASP and the guy in there ran some diagnostics and the phone passed all the tests. I even asked this guy if they could replace the screen, given the fact that I still have Apple Care and I've been experiencing this issue for a while and he refused and he told me I'd have to reach out directly to Apple and that he could not replace the screen because it wasn't cracked and the device passed all the tests.\n\nUnfortunately there are no Apple Stores in my city, and this AASP, which is well known for giving bad service and leaves too much to be desired, is the only AASP in my city. However, I'm planning on sending my device directly to Apple, but before doing that I have a few questions.\n\nWhen you send your device directly to Apple, are they going to just repalce the phone or are they going to try to repair it?\n\nHas anyone sent their phones to Apple or has taken them to an Apple Store under the Apple care warranty?.....if so, did they just repalce the phone or did they fix it?\n\nI forgot to mention I restored the phone yesterday through itunes, but the issue still persists.\n\nThanks in advance and have a good evening.",

Now some people don’t like getting a refurbished phone but let’s face it your phone is used so you get what you get. They may replace the screen if that is the real issue or they may replace the whole device. I would say you paid for the service, use it.",

It tells me to go to settings to turn on the option to save photos, and when I go to my settings the option to allow images to be saved is just completely gone. I've even tried the in-app way to enable it, and it was completely gone too. This has happened before but just on Pinterest, i've waited it out and it fixes itself eventually but I don't know like the catalyst to fix it.",

        "post_text": "This is a big one but I appreciate anyone who reads through this.\n\nBack in October of 2023, 3 a-holes stole my car along with all of my stuff inside that amounted to over $1k. The police found my car a few towns away and camped out to see if they would come back, but they never did.\n\nDuring all of that the idiots connected their phone to my car and so their name showed up on my dashboard.\n\nFast forward to today. I was deep cleaning my car when I noticed something shining in between my car seat. It was the car thieves iPhone!!!\n\nI charged it up and tried using ‘Siri’ to find out who’s phone it was, but doesn’t work due to it shutting down and now requiring a passcode.\n\nSo my question is:\n\nA. Should I call the officer that helped me and see if they can use the iPhone to track them down? The iPhone is a 16 with an eSIM Card.\n\nAlso, since it’s been so long will the officer even do anything at this point?\n\nOr\n\nB. Should I call Apple support and just reset the phone? I doubt they can do anything since they’ll think it’s stolen. I don’t think there’s a way to factory reset it on my end.\n",
