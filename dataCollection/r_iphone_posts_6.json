With my newest iphone (15), however, I dropped it face down onto my desk while sitting at it. It was a short fall, but now the screen quality towards the bottom is messed up. I have applecare+, and am wondering if anyone has had this issue and how it was fixed. Whenever I looked it up people had small patches of dead pixels or lines, not a complete section of the screen go wonky like this. I can still tap the whole screen and have it register, it just makes things look weird. I’m nervous because I’m still paying this phone off with at&t and hope the only solution isn’t to just replace the whole phone.\n",

You could ask at the Apple Store if there’s a work around to get iOS 16 updated enough to make the phone operational. Technically, an iPhone 8 should run with iOS 16 but it will be without further security updates.  Did you try the software update option through Settings on the phone?  Another option would be to try to update it through iTunes.",

I was messing with it a little bit and experimenting, and during the process I moved my SIM card to that phone and back to my normal phone, which is an iPhone 11 that is not and has never been carrier locked. I decided to include this detail because I'm not sure if it might have caused my problem. This was a couple of days ago.\n\nToday, I realized that, regardless of the number of internet 'bars' I have, and despite the fact that LTE is showing, I have absolutely ZERO internet connection outside of wifi on my normal phone. Not low connectivity, I mean I literally have no internet connection whatsoever. I tried reseating my SIM card, I cleaned it, I reset network settings, anything you would possibly think to do, and I still have the same problem. I am wondering if my SIM card got 'blacklisted' or something without telling me because I put it inside of a carrier locked phone. Please let me know if there's anything you think I should do. Thanks in advance",

So she literally got a new phone yesterday, an S23 FE, but it's still done it at least once today. Although we've talked multiple times around that. Argh. \n\nBy the way, I'm using wifi from my end and she uses her cell data, if any of that makes a difference. \n\nI googled and perused Apple support, but saw nothing that got me answers to all the issues or a resolution.

I've always had android phones due to them being cheaper so making this switch was pretty awesome and I was proud of myself because I bought it with the money I had from working part time.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, I've bought 4 chargers (both apple and off brand) and they all stopped working. The one that lasted the longest lasted 3 months and the one that lasted the least amount of time literally lasted one day. By the 4th one I started to suspect my dear phone was the problem so I took my mom's original apple charger (she was gifted an iPhone X by sis in law because she got the iPhone 15 Plus) and got her a new one. This was last week and today the charger (the thick part between the cable and the grey thing specifically)  suddenly got REALLY hot. Like, it actually hurt to touch it for more than a few seconds then it started **melting** and it remained HOT for almost two hours and during that time I kept holding the cable and I ended up dropping it on my rug and it got stuck there obviously, melting part of my rug :(\n\nThe warranty only covers b\\*ttery (had to censor the word or it wouldn't let me post) related issues for 1 year and 3 yrs for everything else (free of charge). \n\nI'm scared to go to the store and having them say I have to pay to fix it because I don't have the money unfortunately as I have to pay tuition until July then the re-enrollment in August (I ended up going back to college so I don't have a job anymore and my dad pays for tuition but even that money is hard to get from him sometimes. My mom barely makes ends meet and we don't have any extra phones in the house because both of our previous phones couldn't be salvaged)\n\nMy question is, what could this be? Is it the b\\*ttery of something else? ",

The only common factors here are you and your phone. Unless you’re beating the absolute crap out of your chargers, it’s probably the lightning port.",

        "post_text": "So earlier today I experienced for the first time my iPhone going black and not turning on, maybe the reason for it is because I installed iOS 18 Developer Beta 1. This is my first iPhone ever and I used it since April. I managed to turn it back on by clicking volume up, volume down and holding side button for 40 seconds. I’m just curious if it’s going to go black again. Because when I turned it on camera didn’t work for 5 minutes, Viber didn’t work till afternoon and just started working when I offloaded app in settings then uninstalled it and installed it again. I’m   a bit scared because friend of mine about a year ago experienced a problem with her iPhone 12 Mini going white and displaying Attempting to recover data. Any opinions on this would be appreciated.\n",

Be aware, the backup create on iOS 18 cannot be resotred on iOS 17. You should create a backup with iTunes before upgrade to iOS beta.\n\nIf you really want to try iOS beta, choose public beta next time beucase it will be stabler than developer beta, but iOS beta is not stable in general.",

Unlocking and swiping sometimes takes up to half a minute. The camera takes ages to open and shoot. I have the feeling that the screen sometimes runs at 20 hz and there is occasionally a noticeable input lag. My memory is not full, the software is up to date, I've tried reboots, it doesn't get too hot either, what can I do? Apps take soo much longer to start in comparison to my older iPad.\n\nIt's really frustrating.\n\n\n",

My phones audio works fine: FaceTime, YouTube, Spotify, both speakers and AirPods, I can hear it all perfectly. However, whenever I try to call someone on the phone, I can’t hear them and they can’t hear me. I’ve tried resetting my network settings, turning the phone on and off again, dragging the ringer volume back and forth, and more. At most restarting my phone lets me make a call where I can hear them for about 2 to 4 minutes before it either goes silent, gets static like, starts to almost crackle, or repeats the last thing they said ad nauseum until I hang up. Like if the last thing they said was “funny” it’d just be there voice going “ny ny ny ny” over and over again until I hang up. This persists until I turn my phone off again and then it messes up again after one or two calls. Anyone have any advice?",

This has been happening since iPhone 12, and there's been no fix.\n\nThere's speculation that this is related to noise cancellation, but ever since Apple removed the setting to disable NC, no one has been able to test that hypothesis.",

I was told that it would cost me around 400$, thats 30% of what i paid for the phone and would take 4 weeks to get it done.. if (big if) i went for the repair would i face any problem after? I dont have a good history with replacing parts.  \n\nIf anyone faced the same issue let me know how it went and if it’s worth to get it repaired. ",

Is there any way I can do this or will i have to lose all my contacts and photos and start over?",

        "post_text": "Hi guys, I recently went to the apple store to restore my ios version. The reason being the iphone was laggy and freezing here and there. I usually do it at home with my windows laptop, the person at the genius bar said that using a windows laptop to restore ios causes lag and bugs. Is that true? I'm kind of worried since the restore was done using the macbook from the apple store. Is there a chance that there could be a virus infection or some sort of spyware implant? ",
