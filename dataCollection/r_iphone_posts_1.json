        "post_text": "Hi all, about a month ago a piece of my charger broke off and was stuck inside of the headphone/charging port and after getting it out, my phone doesn‚Äôt register that my earphones are plugged in. My phone charges fine,  just won‚Äôt work with wired earphones (i‚Äôve tried the earphones on other phones and they work so i know it‚Äôs not the earphones) I have tried everything now to fix it and I think that the port itself must just be broken. I went to a phone repair person and he said that since charging works that my phone is fine and not broken and then proceeded to try sell me wireless earphones so i‚Äôm not sure, but anyways how much would it cost to replace that part? Can it even be done? Thank you. ",

However, the hotspot via iPhone is limited to 3G, making the wifi unusable. Support from J1 sims said that the hotspot is locked to 3G and cannot be upgraded.\n\nIf I put the SIM card in a hotspot device, will it also be limited to 3G? Is there any other solution or a good hotspot program I can use? I really need to use my laptop, but the wifi here isn't working. Additionally, I don't want to pay another $50 for another program; I'm looking for something cheap but decent.\n\nThank you.",

In her case however, the mic defect was due to the fact that she had submerged her device in a bucket of water - thus the resulting damage, ie. secondary mic array, internal speaker, front camara, charging port as well as her screen failed, one by one and eventuatlly went all dead as a result.\n\nIn your particular case, you didn't mention if your device has been subject to any type of damage.

However, if at any time during the dictation I interact with the screen or the keyboard at all, the first letter of what I have dictated reverts immediately to a lowercase letter. For instance, I dictated this entire paragraph, but as soon as I touched the backspace button on the keyboard because of a misheard word, the capital W that started this paragraph turned into a lowercase w.\n\nÔøº it's a strange little bug, and one that I can't seem to find anything about online. Any suggestions?",

Ive noticed that on my Fathers Iphone 15 it doesnt make a sound when in Live Mode, however taking a picture with live mode on my 13 Pro will play the sound that normally plays when youre recording a video. Its just honestly very annoying since I dont want my phone to always make a noise when Im recording something. I live in Germany so the region forced shutter shouldnt be a thing for me.",

Is there anyway I can recover the photos I took off that phone as I have lots from a holiday I went on and would love to get them back! Also, I foolishly do not have them backed up on my iCloud.\n\nEars are open to any suggestions thank you !",
