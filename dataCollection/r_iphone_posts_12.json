Everytime I'm on a call where one or both of us is on speaker phone or when I'm on facetime the audio cuts out at even the slightest sound on my end and vice versa.\n\nA few examples \n\nIf I or someone in the room coughs, the audio cuts out.\n\nIf set down a glass the audio cuts out.\n\nIf someone opens my front door the audio cuts out.\n\nIf someone else is talking in the same room, even at a low whisper, the audio cuts out.\n\nIt's annoying for both me and the person I'm trying to talk to. I'm only getting bits and pieces of the conversation and they're having to constantly repeat themselves.\n\nIt's not quite as bad with Facetime, because I can occasionally guess what's being said through lip reading, but it's still a pita.\n\nThe only solution I've found is to make sure I'm in a completely silent environment during calls, which is easier said than done.\n\nAnyone know what's causing this and how to fix it? \n\nAdvice, solutions and tips would be greatly appreciated!

        "post_text": "I just recently purchased a refurbished 12 mini. I know, I’m pretty far behind on models. But anywho, the phone is great. I like everything about it… except the Bluetooth. I don’t know if it’s the phone or user error, but it makes me extraordinarily angry at times. \n\nMy new phone has an issue connecting to my radio in my truck. It’s a simple Boss Audio Bluetooth receiver single din head unit, nothing special. The iPhone SE I had before this phone had no issue hooking to it. As soon as I fired the truck up, it would connect. This phone either connects only after I select it from my Bluetooth settings, or on most occasions tells me connection unsuccessful. When it does connect, it works wonderfully until I get a phone call. If I answer my phone, it will automatically disconnect from the radio and usually won’t reconnect. \n\nAnother issue I’ve got is with my wireless earbuds. I literally just bought a pair of Skullcandy Sesh ANC earbuds. They connected instantly, which honestly was a bit of a surprise. They work great… unless I pause my music. If I don’t have something actively playing for some time between 30 seconds and two minutes, my phone automatically disconnects and then reconnects. It’s the weirdest thing. \n\nI’m just wondering if anyone else has had an issue with something similar to this problem. I love the phone, but this Bluetooth junk is garbage. ",

        "post_text": "what's up guys\n\nso, on my 13PM, i had to reset all settings. when i did, i got logged out of imessage and facetime. now i tried activating it again with my phone number, but now it gives me this error code shown in the picture. i contacted apple support and they were of no help. they just told me to hard reset my phone, and then reset my network settings, and then a bunch of other silly stuff which didn't work. i factory reset my phone now, but it's still not working. worst of it all, i can't even send like real sms text messages. i contacted my carrier, they said the problem's not on their end, and figure it out with apple. what's also weird is, i get 2FA codes a lot later than i request them. what now? thanks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9dyme1dvpt5d1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=39f8804e69b8fd94869ffd02f9b257839ba8afaf",

This is something I would definitely get used to if you're going back to an iPhone.  The move to iOS app has always been kind of shitty, but Apple isn't really looking to poach customers since so few people jump between ecosystems, so it's a bare minimum effort kind of thing again.\n\nHonestly I can't think of anything that wouldn't transfer that you couldn't just use Google to bridge the gap. I would use Google Photos and you can still import Google contacts over. Files can be moved directly over Google Drive.  It's not like home screen layout transfers or anything like that, so really the move to iOS app is pretty pointless anyway.",

Yes, I figured out how to change the homescreen, but I want one of the STOCK photos for the homescreen. The stock photos only come up when trying to change the Lock Screen, Home Screen only lets you choose from photos or that gradient tool. It’s annoying, why did they do this to us. I swear every year I get closer to getting a different phone just for the headphone jack back.",

When I was factory resetting the phone, it gave me the option to delete the e-sim or keep it. My friend told me I was supposed to keep it or else it would also delete the data on my current phone. \n\nWhen I reset the old phone and it turned on, it was as if it had never been used before. Tried taking me through the whole step-by-step process by choosing a language and all that other stuff. So I figured it was fine, that it everything was deleted and was safe to sell. \n\nI ended up selling it to an old friend and not long after that I received a text with an Apple ID code. Could my information still possibly be on the phone since I never deleted the e-sim?? ",

I can sort of remember playing a game on my phone or watching a TV show during the activity. I’m wondering if there is a log that records when an app is used. I know that the storage section in the settings tells you the last date, but I need specific times.",

The invisible line in question is from the left side of the notch all the way vertically down from that startin point and has a width of 1/3 of the notch from the left. This entire area isn't working/unresponsive. I find it annoying as I cant use certain letters on the keyboard and can't click anywhere on that part and it's frustrating. I tried restarting but it didnt work, after some time it started working again but then after a few days it started happening again. The lines you would see on an iphone screen suggesting that area is damaged isn’t visible on my phone, it looks completely normal if you glance at it, there are no visible line(s), but when you type or use that part of the screen, it wont respond. It isn't a visible line, but rather an area that is unresponsive and won't work. Any ideas about what I can do to fix it? I have included a picture for reference as well. I've tried searching for it on forums, and even encountered people with similar problems on Apple Discussionz but none of them had a solid solution either.",

I understand my phone is old and maybe I don’t update it enough(i tend to ignore updates, I updated a year and a half ago from 1.14 straight to 1.16 and don’t remember the least time I updated again). Can anyone tell me what could the problem be?  This is a iPhone 8 btw, if that at all effects the problem.",

My instinct was to turn my phone off and then back on, but after I turned it off the screen would not turn back on and still has not.\n\nI have tried to force reboot it several times. This has not worked...the odd thing is that the phone is still \\*on\\*: it vibrates, plays ringtones per usual, etc. The screen just will not turn on or function in any way.\n\nI believe it's a software issue rather than a hardware one because the software froze right as I was opening an app and I haven't experienced any hardware issues up to this point. Not sure what to do, as I've yet to find a solution online.\n\nRight now it's in recovery mode downloading a new iOS update because thankfully iTunes was able to recognize it. Crossing my fingers that the iOS update will fix it but not holding my breath.\n\nHas this happened to anyone else?",

I was a quarter done but decided to go to a professional. I made an appointment but it was a few days away. During those few days I had the problem that my iPhone just restarted every 2-3 minutes.

My first thought when unboxing it was that it felt extremely cheap compared to other braided cables in my household. But I’ve never had any Apple cable break on me in any way and I don’t expect this one to be the first. A bit amazed at *how* yours broke, though. I guess the glue or whatever they used in there didn’t hold up very well.",

You might need to purschase premium/pro but there should be a free trial.\n\niOS intelligently adjusts the refresh rate of the display to get as much battery life as possible. If your screen is static and running 120 Hz that would be huge waste of energy considering the small battery on a phone.\n\nAlthough I wish there was like an agressive mode So that it'll lock 120 Hz or allow it to go 120 Hz more often. Because when you are really thinking about the smoothness and your eyes are used to really high refresh rates you start to notice those drops. But and then that wouldn't be the Apple way since they know better than the customer :) Which I like most of the time but only sometimes I wish.",

This happens sometimes when it's in the inside pocket of my coat (when I take the dog for a walk for example). I don't know what happens and I don't notice it, but when I pull it out to check the time it's sometimes locked with this message. Sometimes I even have to wait an hour (!). There's no way to bypass this. I need my phone for 2FA to get into my work VPN. I work in a hospital as a doctor and I'm able to work from home but I need to access my work account at all times. This is really frustrating. Is there any way to shut off this feature? Or why does it happen? I don't touch my phone when it's in my pocket. I need to have my phone with me when I leave the house because of previous stated reasons.  \n\nAnd I'm just curious. This is far fetched, I know. But what if, theoratically, this happens and I need to access my work account immediately for patient safety and something happens because I wasn't able to access in time? Who will be responsible? That would be a nice case of finger pointing for sure. ",

My old was one 6 digits. But now that I I try to unlock my phone there is slot for only 6 digits and I can’t input my passcode correctly. My phone has been disabled for 15 mins. I can’t reset passcode using my laptop because I have 20k photos which aren’t backed up in the iCloud. What do I do? ",

Anyway, I dried everything with a towel and went back to sleep. The next morning, my phone was fully charged and everything seemed normal. Later at work, when I tried to plug it in to charge, my screen turned green and started flickering. I could barely make out a liquid warning on the home screen. Now the screen is green, with the normal display faintly visible through it. Black doesn't show at all. I've already tried restarting it and so on. Is there anything else I can do, or is my iPhone done for?",

It has the charger sound, vibrates, etc.\n\nNot sure about the hard restart, they might be doing it wrong but it's the one where you quickly press the volume up button, then the volume down followed by holding the power/side button. Again, I'm not sure if they did it right.\n\nThey can't afford a new screen or to boot it up to a computer or something like that due to storage or something.\n\nAny advice? I will relay any back to the person in need.\n\nThanks",

        "post_text": "So here is one annoying thing. I have two devices, one android and other is iOS device (15 pm) running  17.4. I have my work SIM on android device and i uses its hotspot for my iOS device to stay connected. \n\nHowever whenever i lock my iOS device, it disconnects from the hotspot until i unlock it. No matter what, it never stays connected with the hotspot. Its like it knows it is connected to a hotspot so it disconnects. Because of this, i miss my emails, WhatsApp calls and messages. As soon as i unlock the device, im bombarded with the notifications which were never delivered since my device was apparently offline. \n\nNow this never happens with the home WiFi. Device  always stays connected. It only happens with the hotspot. \n\nI thought it might be the hotspot on android device which might be turning off but i have kept it on always on.  \n\nIs this a bug because this doesn’t seem normal to me. Or is there a setting i need to change so it stays connected with the hotspot?\n\nThanks",
